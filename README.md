## üìá About Me
A technology generalist exploring various facets of the tech world. 

My journey began over 10 years ago building C# desktop and ASP.NET web applications, which led me to develop mobile applications for Android (and even the deprecated Windows Phone). I was introduced to the Cloud world with AWS and GCP on my first internship, leaving me wanting to know more. Before diving into frameworks, I was a superstar in pure HTML/CSS developments, which laid the foundation for my frontend projects using Angular, React, and NextJS, alongside standard libraries like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Mantine. All of these typically relied on a C# or Python backend backed with a database I was most familiar with, MySQL/sqllite at that point in time. There are many more technologies I've uncovered along the way, check out my LinkedIn for a bigger list.

In my professional life, I lead and co-lead teams in architecting and implementing systems on AWS using its full suite of services in the domains of Data Privacy and Data Engineering. This includes managing infrastructure as code (Terraform), navigating networking, developing backend applications in Python, and ensuring seamless deployments with CI/CD practices. 

The start of fully utilising my GitHub repository is long overdue, but the best day to start is today. So, let's begin collating my coding journey and refreshing old projects! üòÅ
