## ðŸ“‡ About Me
A technology generalist, exploring various facets of the tech world. 

My journey began years ago by building C# desktop and ASP.NET web applications, which led me to develop mobile applications for Android (and even on the deprecated Windows Phone). I was introduced to the world of cloud computing with AWS and GCP during my first internship, and my curiosity has been piqued ever since. Before diving into frameworks, I was a superstar in pure HTML/CSS developments, which laid the foundation for my frontend projects using Angular, React, and NextJS, alongside standard libraries like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Mantine. These typically relied on a C# or Python backend backed with a database I was most familiar with, MySQL/sqllite, then. There are many technologies I've uncovered along the way ever since, and hopefully with many more to come.

In my professional life, I lead and co-lead teams in architecting and implementing systems on the Cloud using its full suite of services in the domains of Data Engineering and Data Privacy. Apart from the plumbing and orchestrating data pipelines, this includes managing infrastructure as code (Terraform), navigating networking, developing backend applications, and ensuring seamless deployments with CI/CD practices.
